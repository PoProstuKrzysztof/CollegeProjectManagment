# CollegeProjectManagment

## Project for college class

It's main purpose is to handle project managment of class projects. Whole application is fully API-focused. 

## Short description of project

The project revolves around closed and open projects. In closed projects, the leader has the authority to add team members, while in open projects, the leader selects team members based on submissions. The user who creates the project becomes its leader but can transfer this role to another team member. User management includes registration, verification, and profile editing, which includes programming languages, known libraries, frameworks, and self-assessment of skills.

The project can go through various stages: created, team composition completed, initiated, completed stage/added feature, being tested, and completed. A completed project must include a repository link, meaning the project cannot be marked as finished without providing a link.

Each team member who has contributed at least 3/4 of the project's duration receives prestige points. The scoring system may depend on project settings, such as difficulty. The system allows browsing all users based on technologies and programming languages. The team is represented as a list of users, and each user has an assigned role, such as developer, tester, leader, or DevOps.
